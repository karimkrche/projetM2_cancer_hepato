# 🏥 Risk Factors for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

###📊 Predicting HCC risk based on comorbidities and alcohol consumption

##📌 Context

Alcohol is a major contributor to over 700 diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a severe form of liver cancer.
Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) are at an increased risk of HCC due to associated factors like obesity and hypertension.

##🔍 Research Question:
Can we predict the risk of HCC in T2D patients based on clinical characteristics and recorded alcohol consumption?

##🏥 Dataset

Source: Hospitalization records of T2D patients over 10 years.
Recorded variables:
Medical factors: Obesity, hypertension, age, sex
Alcohol consumption: A medically recorded variable (but does not capture hidden alcohol use)
HCC development: Target variable

##🎯 Objective

The goal is to build a predictive model that assesses the risk of HCC in patients with T2D, considering their clinical risk factors.

##🔬 Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (handling missing values, feature transformation)
Statistical analysis (correlations, hypothesis testing)
Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Model evaluation and interpretation (feature importance, cross-validation)
